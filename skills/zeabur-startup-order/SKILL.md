# Zeabur Startup Order Issues

## Symptom

```
Connection refused :5432
connection to server at "X" failed
OperationalError: connection failed
```

## Cause

Service starts before dependency (DB/Redis) is ready.

## Fix

Add wait logic to service command (command MUST be inside `source`):

```yaml
# Python example
spec:
  source:
    image: myapp:latest
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - "python manage.py wait_for_db && exec ./entrypoint.sh"
```

Or for Node.js:
```yaml
spec:
  source:
    image: myapp:latest
    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - "until nc -z postgres 5432; do sleep 1; done && node server.js"
```

## Quick Fix

If DB is now ready, just restart the failed service:
```bash
npx zeabur@latest service restart --id <id> --env-id <env-id> -y
```
